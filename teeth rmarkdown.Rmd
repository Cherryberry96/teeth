```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```



```{r}
mtcars.pca <- prcomp(mtcars[,c(1:7, 10, 11)], center = TRUE,scale. = TRUE)
summary(mtcars.pca)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
